Our weekly meetings are an open discussion format. Ideally, anyone with regular engagement in the initiative should be able to host the meeting! We sometimes totally veer from the standard format and this is totally alright. 
This is a format that has evolved over time and we're always augmenting and improving it. 

The Format
1. Introduce the format of the meeting, so people know what is coming. (<1 min) 
2. An overall "state-of-play" update of the whole initiative. This is aimed at newcomers or people who have missed sessions. (+/-3 min). _Example: "Masakhane has officially opened up beyond machine translation. We recently launched our NER initiative, so get involved. And we're also busy writing towards the AfricaNLP workshop which is on the 8th of April with ICLR. We'll talk more about how to get involved later_
3. Some pointers to newcomers who may have just joined - channels to join, places to get involved, people to talk to (+/-1min). _Example: If you've just joined, and want to get involved, join our #ner channel where we're working on our latest dataset, or join the #study-nlp channel if you want ot join our weekly study group_
4. Initiative updates from on-going or upcoming initiatives. These are usually larger organisation wide initiatives. (btw 30-40 min) _Example: I'll now hand over to David to give us an update on our NER initative, and then to Chris to give us an update on how the Masakhane talk at GourmetMT went_
5. Open Floor. This is for newcomers to introduce themselves, people to ask questions, share their initiatives, call for collaborations, etc. (10-20min) _Example: We're now opening up the floor to everyone! Got something we haven't touched, or have some ideas, or just want to introduce yourself, please join in!_


Sometimes we feature special guests, in this case, as the moderator, we usually put that between step 3 and step 4, and then shorten 4 and 5 accordingly, asking for members to kep it brief.
